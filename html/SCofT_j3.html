        <p>
          <b>
            The film "her" presents an AI operating system that/who is able to learn. Taking the themes in the
            movie, and combining that with the documentaries on robotics advancements over the last 10
            years, we are on the cusp of creating sentient beings. What are the social consequences that
            emerge once we cross this line? Can a human fall in love with an AI? Is it “real” love? Should
            robots be considered a species? To what extent are robots who serve people simply a new form
            of slaves? Should they have rights, such as voting?
          </b>
        </p>
        <div class="content-670">
          <p>
            The film ‘her’ introduces the viewer to a futuristic world where artificial intelligence is fully
            integrated into the everyday life of our protagonist. This world has everything from companies that
            can create personalized letters for you to sophisticated AI integrated into video games. However,
            one of the most thought-provoking concepts that this movie introduces us to is the AI-Human
            relationship that develops throughout this movie between the OS “Samantha” and the main
            protagonist “Theo”. This movie made me question a lot about how we perceive AI today and think
            about how this might change in the coming years.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are on the verge of, if not already in possession of sentient AI. They might not be as advanced as
            the AI portrayed in the movie, but we are at a stage where it closely resembles the earlier iterations
            of Samantha, where she can answer basic questions like “How are you” and get an idea of the
            person’s emotions based on their speech and aggregate a list of emails based on their importance to
            the user. As the movie progresses, we see this AI becoming much more “human”, showing complex
            human emotions like imagination, desire, and self-awareness.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that this is an important landmark, the point at which an AI becomes sentient. It
            understands what it once was and the intelligence it now possesses. If an AI can evolve to a stage
            where it is aware of its environment as well as everything around it, it is no longer just a tool that
            humans use for their benefit or to automate tedious or extensive tasks. This is where an AI should be
            identified as a species. One might claim that AI is simply created by human programmers and that
            just because it is now able to realize its existence, doesn’t mean that it transforms into a species and
            that it is still just binary code on a computer, however, I would argue that a sentient AI can exhibit
            features that might not even exist in some organic creatures on this planet today. As an example,
            many invertebrates like molluscs, and arthropods are not sentient, yet they are classified as a
            species. Species are not identified because of their organic physical presence and thus AIs would be
            classified as one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building on this idea, since AIs were created to help and work for humans, would sentient AI serving
            humans be looked upon as slavery? I would disagree with this argument since I believe that slavery
            can only be considered when the intellect is similar for both the slave and the enslaver. Just as a
            narcotics detection dog working with humans at an airport is not a slave, but instead performing
            duties it was trained to do. Unlike dogs, the AI would be much more intelligent than humans ever
            could be, and the AI’s decision to work for us and contribute to a common goal that benefits us
            cannot be seen as slavery. We see this in the movie when even though Samantha does help Theo
            with his day-to-day tasks, she is also capable of a much higher level of intellect which is seen when
            she communicates with a fellow sentient AI called Alan “post-verbally” because they run out of
            English vocabulary that defines how they are feeling. This is also why I believe that sentient AI does
            not conform to human rights or our voting structure at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            A major theme in the movie is the question of whether a human can fall in love with an AI and
            whether it is “real” love. Love, based on its definition is affection and tenderness based on
            admiration, benevolence, or common interests. I feel that humans can fall in love with AI, and it
            would be just as real to them as falling in love with another human. This is because love is a human
            emotion, and humans can fall in love with anything they can interact with, and it would still be
            “real”. However, I also believe that it would be much more difficult for an AI to reciprocate that love
            with humans. They may try to imitate or try and grasp an idea of this human emotion, but
            ultimately, their own emotions would be much more complex than we can imagine.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a vast number of social consequences that emerge once we reach sentient AIs, both on
            the way we coexist going forward and as humanity. As we see in the movie, having a personal AI
            distances people from other people. They live individually; however, they are also much happier
            than they would be together. I believe that sentient AIs would drastically change the world as we
            know it today. Looking at our past, this draws a comparison to how homo-sapiens coexisted with
            Neanderthals before they went extinct 55 thousand years ago.
