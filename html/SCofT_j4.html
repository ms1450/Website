        <h1 class="entry-title">Journal 4: Theorizing Disability</h1>
        <p>
          <b>
            Jaegar and Bowman (2005) introduce the history of the concept of disability. In this journal, I
            want you to define and discuss the concept of disability, including its limitations. Next, go online
            and research 1-2 technologies that reduce or eliminate the impacts of a disability on a person, to
            examine how these different technologies can help breakdown problematic and limiting views of
            disability. Lastly, discuss why some emerging technologies reduce the “otherness” imposed on
            people with a disability, while others maintain it. What gains exist by maintaining “disability”
            and for whom?
          </b>
        </p>
        <div class="content-670">
          <p>
            Disability, as described by Paul T. Jaeger and Cynthia Ann Bowman in their book “Understanding
            Disability” is not static, it is ever-changing, and its definition is adapted to fit into whatever society
            perceives it to be. It can be a physical condition, impacting our bodies and how we interact with the
            world around us, or it can be a cognitive condition, impacting our minds and our surroundings. Just
            as we have defined gender, race, or language, disability is a social construct.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are four primary perspectives on disability: Medical, Social, Materialistic, and Post-modern.
            The medical perspective considers the disability as a complication with the human anatomy, a
            mistake that needs to be corrected so that the person with a disability can return to a more
            “normal” state of being. The Social perspective views the disability as a result of society defining a
            “normal” state of being to begin with. Since the “normal” state is something created by us, anything
            outside this state of being would be considered a disability. The Materialistic perspective, like the
            medical perspective, considers disability as a limitation to human productivity. However instead of
            working to return it to a “normal” state, it considers the person with a disability as a disadvantage,
            they are viewed as a less competent equivalent of a “normal” person. The Post-modern perspective
            considers that there is no fixed definition or explanation of disability. Every incident is unique, and
            the concept of disability is just a collection of these unique incidents. I believe that disability lies
            somewhere between the Social and the Post-modern perspectives, it is something we as a society
            decide to classify as a disability, but at the same time, there is no set of explanation for it. It is just a
            collection of individual experiences coming together to define a condition.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the research I did about emerging technology trying to help people with disabilities, I found
            two instances of technology that could reduce the impacts of disability on a person. The first is an
            Exoskeleton designed by a company called “ReWalk Robotics” in Massachusetts, USA. This Exo-suit
            helps people with lower limb disabilities sit, stand, walk, and turn. It also allows them to climb and
            descend stairs independently. This tool would help people with disability become more independent
            and give them the ability to perform tasks that they see others in society perform daily, like walking,
            standing, and turning. This technology is attempting to eliminate the “otherness” of not being able
            to walk and I believe it partly succeeds in that. However, I also think that sense of “otherness” would
            persist. Even though the person with a disability would be able to walk and stand, they would still
            have this large device, attached to their legs without which they would not be able to perform these
            “normal” tasks. I feel that if there is a visual element of assistance attached to someone, society
            would maintain the feeling of “otherness” to people with disability. In the coming future, when this
            technology is almost invisible, I do see it almost completely reducing the feeling of “otherness”
            imposed on the person with a disability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another technology that I discovered was a pair of Augmented Reality glasses created by the
            company XRAI Glass based in London. These glasses convert audio input into a visual output by
            turning speech and conversations into subtitles that can be seen on the glasses in real-time. These
            glasses aim to help the deaf and hard of hearing, better adjust to the “normal” world around them
            using Augmented reality. I think that this is a good concept and over time, these glasses have huge
            potential. With good speech recognition software and the ability to transcribe speech to text in realtime, they would be very helpful for people with disability. I also feel like this would reduce the
            feeling of “otherness” that gets imposed on a person with a disability because it uses an everyday
            tool like sunglasses and incorporates it into their condition.
          </p>
          <p>
            A major theme in the movie is the question of whether a human can fall in love with an AI and
            whether it is “real” love. Love, based on its definition is affection and tenderness based on
            admiration, benevolence, or common interests. I feel that humans can fall in love with AI, and it
            would be just as real to them as falling in love with another human. This is because love is a human
            emotion, and humans can fall in love with anything they can interact with, and it would still be
            “real”. However, I also believe that it would be much more difficult for an AI to reciprocate that love
            with humans. They may try to imitate or try and grasp an idea of this human emotion, but
            ultimately, their own emotions would be much more complex than we can imagine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although “Disability” is an everchanging concept, its existence does have significance. While we are
            far from perfectly identifying, classifying, and accommodating disabilities, I believe that in some
            cases, especially for people with disability that need extra care or have a severe condition, this term
            does help create awareness and encourage people to assist and look out for these individuals. Even
            though society has this idea of a “normal” state of being, having disability challenges this idea and
            forces us to realize that there is no “normal”.
