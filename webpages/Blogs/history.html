                    <p>
                        Ever since 8th grade, when all my friends were playing soccer outside, I was in my school's
                        the computer lab being fascinated at the possibilities. Coding, to me felt like a whole new
                        reality where I could create anything I wanted, I realized then that coding has to be
                        something that defines who I am. As I grew older, I became fascinated with all the different
                        programming languages out there, starting from something as simple as Q-Basic, I began
                        looking up all the different programming languages out there, reading tutorials and learning
                        as much as I possibly could. With this, I was able to develop a strong skill set early on,
                        and had a good understanding in most of the popular coding languages, this included Python,
                        Java, C++ and even Scratch just for the sake of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I became familiar with programming, I came across Ubuntu, as a kid who had only known
                        about macOS and Windows, finding this whole new operating system changed my perspective on
                        technology. I then began looking into different operating systems, their file structures and
                        how to communicate with them. <a> When I found out about Computer Security, I knew this was
                        something I had to pursue. </a> My Podcasts were now all related to CyberSecurity, I began
                        practicing BASH coding and playing around Kali Linux in my free time. My favourite TV Show
                        became Mr Robot.

                        Currently, I am a fourth-year student at Rochester Institute of Technology pursuing a
                        bachelor's degree in Computing Security. I have participated in a ton of computing
                        competitions and hackathons through which I learnt problem-solving and application of my
                        programming skills to real world problems. One of my favourite competitions is the
                        'Red Vs Blue' competitions which involves two teams battling out in the digital warzone. The blue team,
                        defending their infrastructure, attempting to protect and secure services, while the red
                        team attacks it with custom tools and techniques, trying their best to maintain persistence.
                        At the end, both teams coming together to discuss the actions they took and walking everyone
                        through the process. This competition developed rapid response as well as familiarity with
                        different systems. I have also interned at a Security Operation Center where I was able
                        to hone my research and presentation skills as well as learn to use SIEM and SOAR. Some of
                        my completed courses include Web Application Security, Cybersecurity Policy and Law,
                        Cryptography, Database and Data Modelling, Cyber Defence Techniques and Network Services.
                        I am also a member of my university's RITSEC club that discusses current security related
                        events occurring throughout the world.
