        <h1 class="entry-title">Journal 9: Hacktivism</h1>
        <p>
          <b>
            Research hacktivism online (include links to your sources at the end of your journal). What is
            hacktivism? Why did it emerge? What social needs does it fit? Is it activism or cybercrime?
            Lastly, take a stand and make a case for or against it---justify your claims with evidence.

            Hacktivism is the use of computer technology to achieve a social or political agenda through legally
            ambiguous means. It is a combination of two terms, Hacking and Activism. Most commonly,
            hacktivism targets government or corporate agencies, but it can also include any institutions,
            religious groups, or other parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hacktivism lies in the boundaries of four different limits. These are Civil Disobedience, Hacking,
            Online Activism, and Cyberterrorism. While Civil Disobedience and Hacktivism both share unrest
            towards a political or social structure, hacktivism involves an online presence, and actions to be
            taken on the internet. Hacking is not considered hacktivism due to its large range of motivations,
            while hacking done for social or political motivations is classified as hacktivism, there are many other
            motivations such as money, ego, entertainment, and status. Online Activism is the use of social
            media, emails, podcasts, and petitions to raise awareness and motivate the audience to act toward a
            set goal. This differs from Hacktivism as it does not obstruct normal computer activity or break any
            laws or policies. Cyberterrorism is social or politically motivated hacking done for the sole intention
            to cause harm to the victim, this could either be loss of life or severe economic damage. Hacktivism
            on the other hand is not done to cause harm, but instead to spread awareness and be heard by
            others. Individually, these four terms do not define or relate to hacktivism, however, collectively
            they provide us with the meaning of Hacktivism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hacktivism first emerged in 1996 through a hacker collective called “Cult of the Dead Cow”. The
            primary reason for its emergence was the growing importance of the internet as a means of
            communication. Protests and disagreements have been an important part of history; people have
            always demonstrated their need to be heard and get their message across even before the invention
            of the internet. Earlier this was done through rallies held outside city halls and letters sent to
            newspaper editors or government officials, however, it was all geographically localized. With the
            emergence of the Internet, people could communicate and interact with each other regardless of
            their physical location. They were now also able to find and collaborate with other like-minded
            individuals with the same ideologies and philosophies. Hacktivism allowed these individuals to
            collaborate and make a statement and spread their ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that like almost everything, Hacktivism can be both good and bad. On one hand, it breaks
            crucial laws and policies, accessing sensitive classified information and disrupting important services
            and organizations. On the other, it provides individuals with a chance to stand up for what they
            believe in and make a difference. I am a strong advocate of free speech, open-source technology,
            and freely available information, and I think that it is not only important but necessary for hacktivism
            to exist in our society. This is because, even though hacktivism involves illegal attacks and breaks
            various laws and policies, it brings forth necessary change in our society. The laws and policies in
            place are not perfect, they will never be perfect, and we need hacktivism to help convey the voice of
            people who feel left out and unheard by the current government. Hacktivism brings forth positive
            change, and it aims to not only identify any political or social issues in our society but also push us
            toward improving ourselves. Two of the major hacktivist groups have been LulzSec and Anonymous,
            and both have been successful in bringing positive change by targeting major organizations and
            forcing them to reconsider their current practices. LulzSec has improved the cybersecurity standards
            for various organizations by finding vulnerabilities in their websites and publishing their findings
            online, forcing them to improve their security standpoint. Anonymous has been actively involved in
            anti-piracy movements, attacking child pornography websites, and taking on ISIS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hacktivist groups like these motivate others and represent standing up against bad actors in the
            modern era of the internet like many people have before them.
