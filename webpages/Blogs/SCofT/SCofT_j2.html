        <p>
          <b>
            Kile (2013) has a lot to say about the importance of automation and machine-aided thinking
            (AMAT) as a transformative technology for society. Reviewing his discussion about Large-Scale
            Systems (LSS), do you agree or disagree with his perspective? Why? Contrasting these ideas
            with the technological breakthroughs we’ve studied on robotics including artificial intelligence
            (AI), which concerns of his carry greater or lesser validity to you? Based on the evidence
            presented, and your scholarly critical assessment of that information, why?
          </b>
        </p>
        <div class="content-670">
          <p>
            In his article “Artificial intelligence and society: a furtive transformation”, Kile walks through the
            different aspects of our life that are impacted by the introduction of automation and machine-aided
            thinking (AMAT) and Large-Scale social systems (LSS). While I do agree with a lot of what he says in
            his article, I do disagree on certain factors. We are at a point today where going back to sustained
            living before the introduction of AMAT is no longer a possibility. We rely too heavily on machines
            and automation in our day-to-day lives that simply “unplugging” would cause way more harm than
            benefit. As a result of this, I believe that the impacts of AMAT, whether they are good, like
            advancements in technology, discoveries, and scientific revelations, or bad, like mass unemployment
            or the collapse of our current and past social lifestyles are inevitable.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the major causes of concern that Kile mentioned in his article is mass unemployment. It is the
            feeling of idleness humans will undergo once automation and artificial intelligence take over the
            more complicated jobs in the field. I agree with Kile and believe that this is a real concern, we have
            witnessed from past events that idleness can lead to aggression which can escalate to wars.
            However, I also believe that given some time to get accustomed to these new emerging
            technologies, humanity will find ways around this new technology. As an example, before the
            invention of computers, many mathematicians were hired to calculate a large subset of variables,
            these employees were displaced with the introduction of devices that were so much faster and more
            efficient than them. On one hand, the introduction of computers caused the downfall of
            mathematicians, but on the other hand, it saw a rise in new fields like computer programmers and
            software developers. A pre-Computer generation had no idea that these jobs could ever exist. I feel
            like we are in a similar situation now with AMAT and LSS. With fewer people being employed to do
            certain tasks, eventually, new jobs will emerge that could range from training or repairing these
            machines, to more people expressing artistic skills or even expressing their humanity. In the near
            future, when AI is proficient enough to accomplish everything that a human is capable of, including
            human emotions. I believe that humans would still use this to their advantage to reach new
            boundaries and find new ways to sustain their ecosystem, though what it would be is difficult to
            imagine right now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another issue with AMAT is the risk of automation of warfare. When machines are put against
            humans, I do not doubt that machines would prevail almost every time. The human element of war
            is becoming more and more distant as new weapons are being created. I agree with Kile that this
            poses a serious threat to humanity. AI, at least for now lacks the emotions and intuition that a
            human can offer, however, I also believe that automation would be a better alternative to using
            humans in warfare. This is because, while machines, for now, lack intuition, humans also tend to
            hold grudges and participate in war crimes, we are not perfect in our judgments of a situation. AI on
            the other hand works on a predefined set of code, a hard ruleset that dictates what can and what
            cannot be done. War is always ugly, and the best outcome we can hope for is to minimize casualties
            and misjudgements through automation. I also believe that if an AI reaches the intellect where it can
            hold grudges, have emotions, and voluntarily decide on doing harm to others, it will also realize that
            the adversary's machines and their AI are far more important assets than adversary humans
            themselves. Humans would be ruled out of participating in wars simply because they would be too
            inefficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that it is only a matter of time before machines and LSS surpasses human intelligence and
            can replicate or even improve upon our basic human emotions. If developed enough, they would
            portray a better “human” than humans themselves. As Kile pointed out, I believe that AMAT and LSS
            are a cause for concern, but I also believe that if implemented and utilized correctly, this would be
            much more beneficial to us than it would be harmful.
