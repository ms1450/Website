        <h1 class="entry-title">Journal 6: Cloning Technologies</h1>
        <p>
          <b>
            First, research and describe the status of human cloning as an emerging medical technology
            (within the last 5 years) and discuss its impacts and consequences (both positive and negative)
            for society. Next, Rent & watch The Island (2005). How close are we to a future where The
            Island is a reality? To what extent does our capitalist (for-profit) political economy support such
            an imagined future coming true?
          </b>
        </p>
        <div class="content-670">
          <p>
            Cloning, according to the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) is the process of
            producing a genetically identical copy of a biological entity. Almost 30 years ago, humans were able
            to clone a sheep named Dolly as the first mammal to be successfully cloned. People believed that
            cloning was the next big step in the medical industry, it could lead to the eradication of genetic
            diseases and birth defects. This consequently led to scientists researching human cloning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following Dolly, I came across several articles referring to the successful cloning of monkeys at the
            beginning of 2018, proving that the cloning of humans would be theoretically possible, however as
            this article and various other articles go on to state, human cloning in the current medical
            landscape is expensive and unethical. This is because human cloning is much more intricate as
            compared to other mammals, it would involve millions of dollars’ worth of research and
            experimentation, and it would require women to donate eggs and serve as surrogates for the cloned
            embryos. While researching human cloning, one important factor that might get overlooked by
            people is that the process of human cloning is not duplicating. A clone will never be the same person
            as the original, they would not share personalities, experiences, or morals. This also raises several
            ethical and moral dilemmas concerning the life a clone might lead. The environment it is raised in, its
            identity, and its purpose for existence might have a significant impact on its psyche.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that while human cloning would prove to be useful in terms of saving human lives and
            making considerable progress in medical science through experimentation and testing, it would be
            impractical in the long term and devalue human life. ‘The Island’ directed and coproduced by
            Michael Bay in 2005 is a thriller dystopian movie that portrays a world where human cloning is used
            on a massive scale as an insurance policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this movie, humans buy clones of themselves to harvest organs from in the event they sustain
            injuries. Although theoretically sound, this idea falls apart in its implementation both practically and
            ethically, sustaining a large number of human clones would take a significant number of resources.
            In a future where we have sufficient technology as portrayed in the movie, to be able to replicate
            and clone humans, it would be much more effective to quickly synthesize the damaged organ in a
            lab environment without having to deal with sentient human clones walking around the facility.
            Ethically, I would compare this to slavery, the human clones are designed to be just as intellectually
            capable as their hosts, yet they are treated as a product to be used by a third party. They are also
            locked underground and constantly monitored, whilst limiting their social interactions. This would
            not only take a huge toll on their well-being but also be illegal and immoral.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, I believe that our society, even if in a capitalist political economy would never support
            what was portrayed in ‘The Island’. Logistically, it would be near impossible to covertly produce
            human clones and provide their services, governments have regular audits and inspections in place
            that are performed on medical organizations to ensure they are following proper conduct,
            moreover, it would be extremely difficult to have thousands of employees required to sustain such
            an endeavour and prevent any whistle-blowers. If this practice is publicly disclosed, the heavy
            backlash from the community will ensure that it does not continue. Such a practice might take place
            illegally on a much smaller scale; I believe that it would not be sustainable and the risk of
            maintaining such a practice would be too much compared to its reward.
          </p>
          <p>
            While our medical technology every day gets a little closer to a future where human cloning is
            possible, the scientific research required, and its moral implications will ensure that it remains
            nothing but science fiction.
