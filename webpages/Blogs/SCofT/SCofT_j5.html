        <h1 class="entry-title">Journal 5: Digital Duplication Technologies</h1>
        <p>
          <b>
            Consider the Black mirror episodes Entire history of you and White Christmas. Is it moral to
            create a digital duplication of a person who has died? Of yourself? Who “owns” that copy? If the
            copy is backed up on a cloud server, should the software manufacturer be able to use a copy for
            their own needs as well? Why or why not?
          </b>
        </p>
        <div class="content-670">
          <p>
            Black Mirror’s "Entire History of You" and "White Christmas" introduces us to a dystopia where most
            of the population has “Zed Eyes”. This audio-visual recording technology is housed inside your brain,
            it uses your eyes as the camera, and it can record and replay memories by controlling a small remote
            controller. Through the stories shared in the Black Mirror episodes, we see how this technology can
            be used to project your memories onto other devices, share your memories with others, replay your
            own or others’ memories and interact with others and even block or blacklist individuals. We are
            also introduced to an addition to this technology called an “Egg”, using the host's memories, it was
            able to perfectly recreate your personality and consciousness digitally. Commercially this was used in
            the show to improve home AIs as well as by law enforcement agencies to interrogate criminals for a
            confession. This led me to ponder the morals and ethics of digital duplication.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that it is immoral of us to create a digital duplicate of anyone. When you create a digital
            duplicate of a human, you not only create another entity capable of critical thinking and reasoning
            but also capable of introspection and a being with consciousness. This is similar to childbirth, but
            instead of the child having to learn basic cognition and comprehension, they are just as capable as
            their host. Using this being to perform trivial tasks as seen in the movie, like making toast or setting
            up the day’s schedule, is a recipe for disaster. While thinking about this prospect, I was reminded of
            another Black Mirror episode, namely “Black Museum”. In this episode, the consciousness of an
            individual is transferred over to a doll-like device after the passing of an individual. The show tackles
            the stress and discomfort this new being might feel as they can no longer interact with the world as
            they had learned to, but only through a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a situation where the host dies and a copy of them is created, that new being is no longer just a
            part of the host it came from, it is capable of critical thinking, and has had the same learning
            experiences and knowledge that the host once did. I believe that this ‘Copy’ should be considered an
            independent entity and be given just as many rights as the original deceased host. I believe that it
            would not be morally justified to own this entity. I can see a future where companies provide digital
            duplication as a service after death so that individuals can live on after passing away, however even
            in this situation, the copy will not be slaves to someone else, they would be allowed to exist freely in
            their domain. I believe that this would be strongly enforced because the deceased would have a
            significant number of individuals who would want their loved ones to be safe and happy, they would
            ensure that these digital copies were given sufficient privileges and freedom, since they are in
            essence, the souls of their loved ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            This might not stop companies and software manufacturers from using copies of these individuals
            for their benefit, as mentioned in the “White Christmas” episode for testing video games and
            observing how individuals interact with various stimuli. For the companies, this might be a very
            efficient and accurate method of getting the information they desire and help them perfect their
            marketing and promotional strategies. A comparison of this would be manufacturing companies
            using child labor, although this was beneficial to the companies since they could hire children in
            large quantities and have them manufacture products for them at very low prices, however, this was
            heavily looked down upon by the public and the companies were heavily discouraged from
            performing these practices. I do not doubt that no matter how wrong, these practices do still exist in
            some parts of the world, however, companies suffer a greater loss if they get exposed for these
            practices than their gains from performing them. Similarly, in this world where companies could use
            digital duplicates of individuals for their benefit, they would be heavily looked down upon and have
            heavy fines imposed on them if they are discovered.
          </p>
          <p>
            The concept of digital duplication gets even more complicated if we consider more than one
            duplicate being “alive” at the same time, and the implications this could cause. I believe that due to
            these reasons, digital duplication would need to be heavily regulated and governed. The copy should
            be given just as many rights and freedom as its host, anything else, as the episode described it,
            would be ‘barbaric'.
