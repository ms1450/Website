        <p>
          <b>
            Introduction
          </b>
        </p>
        <div class="content-670">
          <p>
            Ransomware in its very fundamental form is malicious software that obstructs the
            workings of a machine or a user’s access to data and its programs till a demand is fulfilled.
            This demand is usually the victim’s money as a ransom and their devices are held as hostages
            by the attackers, although the attackers can ask their victims for anything besides money,
            such as spreading the malware to other machines, revealing sensitive information they might
            be privy to, or even disclosing their attack publicly to humiliate the victims. While other
            malware like a virus or remote access tools might try to hide its tracks and stay within the
            network for as long as possible, collecting information and causing indirect disruptions.
            Ransomware’s main objective is to hold the victim’s machine hostage and demand a ransom,
            to get the victim's attention, the ransomware is as loud and apparent as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the goal of ransomware is to extort a victim, there are four different types of
            ransomware malware, these are Scare, Lock, Crypto, and Wipe. Scare ransomware is
            malicious software that claims to detect a virus or an issue on your computer, it then asks you
            to pay the attackers to resolve the problem. Whilst some Scare ransomwares flood the
            computer screen with pop-up alerts without modifying or deleting any files, others might lock
            the victim’s device. The Lock ransomware locks the user out of their device, making it
            inaccessible. The lock screen displays information like the attacker’s payment address, their
            ransom demand, and sometimes a clock that is counting down to instil a sense of urgency for
            the victims to act. The Wipe ransomware, besides making the device inaccessible, starts
            erasing random software and files from the machine. This forces their victims to act fast to
            get as much of their data back as possible. Lastly, the Crypto ransomware encrypts the data
            on a machine. This way, even though the victim has access to their computer, they are not
            able to work or open any of their files without a decryption key, which is provided by the
            attackers if they are paid their ransom. Crypto ransomware is one of the most well-known,
            common, and dangerous types of ransomwares and is primarily what we think of when we
            talk about ransomware today.
          </p>
          <p>
            The very first instance of ransomware dates to 1989 when a Harvard biologist Joseph L. Popp
            created a ransomware called “AIDS Trojan”, this was distributed on a floppy disk at the
            World Health Organization’s International AIDS conference, and it would encrypt the files
            and demand a $189 ransom from its victims. The very first modern ransomware is
            “Trojan.Gpcoder” which was released in May 2005 and was created by Russian criminals to
            target victims in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. The most notorious ransomware
            to date is the family of “CryptoLocker” which rose to infamy around late 2013. They targeted
            Microsoft Windows machines and spread via malicious email attachments, once infected, the
            machines would then encrypt their local and network files and ask for a ransom to be paid
            through bitcoin or a prepaid cash voucher before a set deadline. If the deadline was not met,
            the malware would then provide an online service to decrypt data for a significantly higher
            price with no guarantee that the data would be released. It took a joint operation conducted by
            various law enforcement agencies including the FBI and Interpol in “Operation Tovar” in
            June 2014 to take down the botnet being used to distribute and maintain this malware.
          </p>
          <p>
            More recently, ransomware has taken a newer approach, instead of being created, distributed,
            and maintained by one organization. Ransomware is now being sold as a product to other less
            technologically inclined criminals. These criminals can then use this malicious service to
            easily target victims and give a share of their earnings to the criminals maintaining the
            ransomware. This is referred to as Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) and has made it extremely difficult
            for authorities to detect and prevent the spread of ransomware.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>
              Analysis of Ransomware
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The first ransomware, “AIDS Trojan” had a timer that would wait until the infected
            devices boot cycled 90 times before the ransom demand popped up. This was done to hide
            the source of the ransomware and prevent anyone from tracking down the attacker. However,
            since the ransom money was to be sent to a post office, law enforcement was able to track
            down the attacker and put an end to “AIDS Trojan”. In the early 2000s, since electronic
            payment was not yet introduced, the victims had to send money through mail, making it very
            easy to track down and stop. This made it difficult, if not impossible for hackers to hide the
            footprint that the paid ransom left behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2005, E-gold and Liberty Reserve services were launched. These were digital currencies
            that allowed users to register and transfer money to other users using only a name, email
            address, and date of birth. Since there was no effort made to verify the identities of their
            users, it was an attractive option for attackers to demand ransom through. However, as the
            cybersecurity landscape improved, email tracking allowed the government to trace any
            purchases made on these platforms. It wasn’t until 2013 with the rise of crypto currencies
            such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, that ransomware dug its roots into our society. Unlike regular
            payment services, cryptocurrencies allowed for anonymous transfer of funds across borders
            without any monitoring and it was very cheap to set up. This made it extremely difficult for
            governments to regulate and track cryptocurrency payments. Cryptocurrencies allowed
            attackers to make anonymous transactions that could not be traced back to them causing a
            giant surge in ransomware.
          </p>
          <p>
            Threat intelligence predicts that ransomware attacks will only continue to rise over the
            coming years. This is due to many reasons, one such reason is the hybrid business model for
            monetization through Ransomware as a Service (RaaS), which makes this business
            professional and well-established, with hackers offering their victims 24/7 help to expedite
            the ransom payment. This is also due to the increase in the sophistication of deployment
            methods that attackers use to gain access to networks. Attackers are learning from past
            ransomware attacks and improving their tactics to make this attack process as streamlined
            and efficient as possible. Another reason for ransomware’s rise is how attackers can easily
            conduct ransomware attacks and can get a large sum of profit from it. The return on
            investment from such an attack makes it a very attractive option to pursue.
          </p>

              Science behind Ransomware
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Ransomware stands out from other conventional malware not only by its
            methodology but also its approach. It does not explicitly target a vulnerability or a flaw in the
            infected computer, instead, it plays with the emotions and the human nature of its victim. It
            convinces the victim that it is much more viable to pay the ransom for their data rather than
            starting over from scratch. Like any hostage situation, it convinces the victim that what is
            being taken from them, is worth spending their money on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ransomware attacks conventionally have three conflicting parties that come into play, the
            victim, the attacker, and the law enforcement agencies. While they all have varying
            motivations and ideologies, they are all linked through the central theme of ransomware. We
            can get a clear understanding of how a ransomware attacks work if we break the attack down
            and understand the situation from the perspective of these three parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            The victim is the owner of the infected machine, they are the metaphorical fly that get
            trapped in the attacker’s cobweb. Their primary motivation throughout the attack is to go
            back to a state of normalcy. This could either be done by paying the attackers the requested
            ransom, or by starting over from scratch. A ransomware attack heavily disrupts work, and the
            affected organizations have a major impact on their sales and workflow. This occurs not only
            through the ransomware, but also through any public disclosures that might take place if they
            decide to inform the authorities or the media about the attack. To minimize the damage
            caused by the attack, organizations often find it better to pay off the ransom than deal with
            the fallout not paying the ransom would cause. However, another issue that looms over the
            victim is the uncertainty that the attackers would follow through with the agreed-upon
            transaction. There is no guarantee that an attacker would follow through and provide the
            decryption key or stolen data once the ransom is paid. Their only way of assessing the
            reliability of an attacker is to interact directly with them or review other companies’
            interactions with ransomware and how the attackers had responded, which itself might not be
            disclosed in many instances.
          </p>
          <p>
            The attacker is often the creator and the handler of ransomware, they must maintain control
            over their interaction with the victim to get them to pay the ransom. They need to portray a
            sense of authority and seriousness such that the victim decides to pay the ransom but also
            appear trustworthy and reliable so that the victim believes they have a chance of getting their
            data back. The attacker’s primary motivation is to create the perfect cobweb such that their
            victim gets trapped in it. Their interaction with the victims is exploitative in a way where
            after the initial attack, the victim becomes their customer, and the product becomes the
            decryption key or the victim’s data being held ransom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Law enforcement agency also plays a vital role in ransomware attacks. While they are not
            impacted directly if one or two small to medium-sized organizations get hit with a
            ransomware attack. Much like how many cobwebs can accumulate to cause trouble, multiple
            ransomware attacks can cause major destabilization in a government’s economy. The primary
            motivation for law enforcement agencies is not to recover the victim’s data but to reduce the
            impact caused by ransomware. Whilst they do help victims by providing their services and
            attempting to track down attackers, following the ransom money, and spreading awareness
            about such attacks and how to defend against them. They also must demotivate victims from
            paying the ransom to the attackers. This is because, this ransom money directly goes to the
            attackers, providing them with the motivation and the funds to attack more organizations.
            Besides tracking down the attackers, they also blacklist the organization that pay the ransom
            to the extortionists and impose heavy fines on them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The complicated interactions between these parties are what makes ransomware a
            challenging malware to stop. Whilst there are ways, we can improve cybersecurity and lower
            the chances of an attack occurring, the human factor behind ransomware and these
            motivations are why it is such a difficult issue to resolve.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>
              Social Consequences of Ransomware
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The human factor plays a pivotal role in ransomware. Even with the use of evolving
            cybersecurity measures, automated systems, and complex intrusion detection systems,
            attackers are still able to gain access to targeted systems by exploiting human error. This
            proves that technology alone cannot eradicate human-induced mistakes. This is also where
            society both impacts and is impacted by ransomware attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, almost every organization that intended to keep up with the technologies has
            established a digital presence. This has enabled organizations to not only cater to a large
            number of customers but also provide fast and efficient services. However, with an increased
            reach, organizations also reveal themselves to more malicious actors seeking to exploit their
            infrastructure. Computers, tablets, and smartphones have risen in their significance in our
            daily lives. Besides work, these devices now act as our only communication with the digital
            society we have created for ourselves. Our digital presence holds more significance to us than
            it has ever held before. Businesses rely heavily on their digital footprint and in many cases,
            these devices are their only source of income.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ransomware attacks use this greater reliance on technology to extort larger funds from their
            victims. Every victim has a set willingness to pay (WTP), this is the amount of ransom an
            attacker can extort from their victims. While this depends on various factors such as whether
            the victim has backups of their data, their budget, and the contents of their data. The attackers
            can get a good idea about their victim’s WTP based on their operational information. They
            can do this by researching the victim’s business online and studying their infrastructure.
            Given that over time, data accumulates, and organizations value their data more, the larger
            and more comprehensive it is, their WTP also increases. A larger WTP directly impacts an
            attacker’s asked ransom which in turn impacts the victim’s valuation of their data. Therefore,
            the more an organization interacts with and has an impact on society, the greater the potential
            ransom an attacker might ask from them gets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides the victims, there are also social implications for the attackers, whilst they can and
            there have been cases where attackers have failed to hold their end of the transaction. The
            entirety of this attack relies on the victim’s belief that they will get their data back. The
            attackers have the responsibility of following through with their end of the deal and helping
            the victim recover their data. If they don’t, this model no longer sustains itself and collapses
            impacting all the ransomware attackers collectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            This way, society plays an active role in shaping ransomware attacks into what they are today
            and how they change going forward. Ransomware itself shapes our opinions of the valuations
            we place on our data. Ransomware attacks greatly impact the society's views of an
            organization, which in turn end up impacting the organization itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this is used by attackers to increase their profits and raise the demanded ransom. The
            social impact and consequences can also be used for defensive measures. Technological
            cybersecurity measures might be able to protect against some of the threats faced by an
            organization but understanding why ransomware works can also help us come up with nontechnological defences that could protect against the exploitation of the human aspect of
            technology. This could be done by spreading awareness about the techniques used by the
            attackers, removing the victim’s ability to trust their attackers, or by making it difficult for
            attackers to get an idea of a victim’s WTP.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>
              Conclusion
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Ransomware is a unique malware that stands out from its counterparts because of
            both its operations and its approach. While other malware might hide within a device and
            exploit vulnerabilities within a system, ransomware seeks to grab its victim’s attention and
            extort money out of them. Where other types of malware might become less practical and
            threatening, ransomware continues to be a major threat to small and medium-sized
            organizations as well as individuals due to its nature of exploiting the human factor in
            technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            With more of our lives moving to the digital domain in these last few years, along with the
            progress we have made in encryption and cryptographic algorithm. Malware has evolved into
            ransomware to take advantage of these changes in our society. The motivations and
            ideologies of the three parties involved the victim, the attacker, and law enforcement agencies
            are what shape modern ransomware into what it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that besides using technological advancements, understanding the social impact and
            consequences that ransomware has better prepares us to defend and mitigate against it.
