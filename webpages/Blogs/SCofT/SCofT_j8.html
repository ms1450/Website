            Networked technology has many benefits. Yet, it also has risks. Compare and contrast the social
            consequences of networked technologies using the Grey’s Anatomy and X-files episodes
            assigned this week. What forms of harassment/power were enabled by networked technology?
            What are the consequences of networked technology? How serious do you feel society at large
            takes the risks of networked technologies? Why?

        <div class="content-670">

            Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that describes physical devices embedded with various software
            and sensors networked together, allowing them to share data and communicate with each other.
            The idea behind IoT is to interlink everyday items making tasks much more informative and, in the
            end, streamlining certain tasks and events. As an example, have the pillow you sleep on, the
            toothbrush you use in the morning and the cup you use to pour yourself coffee be able to talk to
            each other would allow you to identify the best patterns and behaviors to follow when waking up, it
            would help you maintain a healthy morning routine and provide you with insightful information
            which you can use for your benefit. IoT is the natural next step in our technological progression. We
            are now at a stage where sensors and circuits are cheap enough to be affordable by the majority of
            the population, and they are small enough to be embedded into everyday items without much
            effort. As we progress, IoT presence will only increase.
          </p>
          <p>
            IoT and networked technology have many benefits to us, the interconnected sharing of information
            allows us to aggregate large sets of useful data which can be used to make informed decisions. As an
            example, when we go to a doctor with a few symptoms, they might recommend a few treatments
            that might help, but when we tell them about our prior medical history, our current symptoms, our
            allergens, and other medical records, they would be able to recommend us exactly what we might
            need to resolve our condition. Similarly, having more information collected about our behaviors
            allows us to make informed decisions and thus improve our daily lives. However, with a more
            interconnected world, we also open ourselves to a myriad of new issues we will have to overcome.
            As we see in the X-Files episode ‘Rm9sbG93ZXJz’, an interconnected world could be used against us
            to negatively impact every little aspect of our lives. As we see in that episode, everything from the
            smart home that is intended to be used to maintain and manage a house easily, to delivery drones
            and AI-driven cars that are used to provide convenience, if hacked or taken over, can prove life-            threatening to us. The large amounts of aggregated data can be used to understand our every
            behavior and pattern, which can then be used to manipulate and control us.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more convenient and informative networked technology and IoT devices become, the more
            reliant we would be on them. Our day-to-day lives would drastically change from what we know
            today, and it would be difficult if not impossible to go back to a world without IoT devices. A
            negative consequence of this can be seen in the Grey’s Anatomy episode ‘Out of Nowhere’ when a
            hospital’s network infrastructure is hacked. Since all the devices within that medical facility are
            interlinked, the threat actor has control over everything. This includes computers and tablets used to
            view patient medical records, machines that help perform surgeries and operations, lights within the
            operation rooms, and even doors that lock blood and other medical supplies. Internetworked
            infrastructure provides the organization with a single point of failure. If the network gets hacked,
            anything and everything connected within that network are also gone. Within the episode, we see
            that the entire hospital’s operations are impacted, and the doctors and clinicians are unable to
            perform their duties and have no option but transfer patients to a different facility.
          </p>
          <p>
            I feel that while the benefits of IoT and networked technology are widely discussed both by
            companies manufacturing these devices to promote their products and increase buyers as well as
            the consumers that have already been using such devices, the negative consequences and risks this
            technology poses are not widely discussed. I believe that much like any other technology we have
            today, IoT and networked technology has their advantages and disadvantages, however, we need to
            make an informed decision on whether to implement them into our daily lives.
