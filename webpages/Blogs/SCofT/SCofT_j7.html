        <p>
          <b>
            Rent and watch the Black Mirror Episode Nosedive. Next, research and describe China’s social
            credit system. Discuss its impacts and consequences (both positive and negative) for society.
            Who defines what behaviors are acceptable or unacceptable? What are the social consequences
            of this system? Could it be implemented successfully in the US? Why or why not? Use this
            article to get started: https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/10/09/655921710/chinas-social-
            credit-system

          <p>
            The Social Credit Score is a very creative concept, seemingly harmless and safe. If implemented
            correctly, could completely revolutionize the way we live our day-to-day lives. However, if
            implemented incorrectly, it could lead us down a dangerous path, ruining countless lives and posing
            a major threat to an individual’s privacy. The Social Credit Score was created by China to provide a
            ranking to every and all citizens as a way of measuring their trustworthiness. This is done by
            accumulating various datasets such as an individual’s behaviors, social media data, camera
            recordings, purchase trends, and various other information. This is then aggregated into a score that
            is assigned to each of the citizens. If a citizen performs a good deed or is helpful to other citizens,
            their score increases, whilst if they do something bad, their score decreases. China also has a
            blacklist that includes people who have made fraudulent claims and taken loans without paying
            them back. This blacklist is enforced throughout China and everyone in contact with a blacklisted
            citizen is reminded of this as a method of interrogating them until they pay up.

            From a thousand-foot view, this seems like a great idea that would promote good behavior and
            punish bad behavior. It would ensure that every citizen follows the rules and is good towards others,
            at least in areas where they are being monitored and judged. It provides bankers and money
            lenders, an easy and effective way of seeing the individuals they want to do business with and
            avoiding any bad actors. This method would also ensure that any bad acts have consequences and
            that individuals don’t go unpunished. Moreover, the more reliant various services are on this scoring
            system, the more streamlined and easier it would be for the citizens with good scores to get access
            to various services. Black Mirror’s ‘Nosedive’ gives an example of this when we see various living
            estates, airline, and car companies offering better services to individuals with a higher rating.
            On taking a closer look, however, the cracks come into view. Within this social credit system, the
            entity in control of differentiating good behavior from bad behavior has total control over the
            system. They can promote the actions and events they believe to be good behavior while
            distinguishing any actions that might be harmful to them as bad behavior to demotivate others from
            performing such behavior. This would mean taking absolute control over a society, even more so
            than a dictatorship as the entity in power would not only be able to control how their citizens
            behave but also monitor their citizen’s every move. Society will also be heavily impacted by this
            change, as we see in Nosedive, people will force the “good behaviors” onto their lifestyles and
            themselves. We see this happening in Nosedive, where everyone pretends to be nice and helpful,
            they put up a smile and act politely, even though as soon as the spotlight is off them, they revert to
            their original selves. Not only would this put tremendous stress on the citizens, but it would also
            wrongly promote being pretentious and acting nice, even in situations where it might not be
            possible to do so.
          </p>

            I do not think this social credit system will ever be implemented successfully within the US. This is
            because even though it offers many advantages, it significantly hinders democracy. It directly affects
            an individual’s freedom and their right to hold opinions. China can effectively implement this
            throughout its nation due to its strong communistic governance method. The government is in total
            control and can take action and put out policies with little to no resistance from its citizens. This is in
            heavy contrast to US’s democratic governance method, where every new policy is heavily critiqued
            and resisted. Although, I do see a modified version of China’s social credit system eventually coming
            over to the US. Rather than making it a voluntary system where every citizen is automatically
            enrolled in this program, having an “opt-in” credit system would allow certain people to choose to
            opt-in and reap the benefits, while also not imposing any of the restrictions on people who want no
            part to it. They would still have to participate in the normal process of getting access to services. This
            is like how banks can view an individual’s credit score; however, the individual still has control over
            who has access to these records. Whether opt-in or not, the credit score system will eventually end
            up being used by the majority of people, and we need to ensure that sufficient thought has gone
            into its implementation before it’s too late.
