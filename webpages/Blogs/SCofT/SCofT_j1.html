        <p>
          <b>
            Danaher presents a detailed discussion on the possible ethical implications of the use of AI
            personal assistant technology. Lang and Benessere examine their use in court. Do you use an AI
            assistant? Why or why not? If so, for what tasks? Of the arguments presented, with which do you
            agree or disagree? Why? How might you see those arguments put into action in your own life?
            Are there any ethical issues not raised in the articles that you believe are important to consider?
          </b>

          <p>
            AI Assistants are slowly becoming a key aspect of our lives. While not daily, I do occasionally turn on
            the AI feature on my phone, to observe the progress companies have made on their AIs. I usually ask
            them trivial questions followed by follow-ups to see if they can keep the conversation going. When
            AI assistants first came out, much like other people, I was also fascinated by their ability to share
            jokes, play games, and instantly search the web to give me accurate answers. However, over time, as
            the fascination with AI assistants died out, I too stopped using them because I felt that it was faster
            to do the task on my own rather than try to make the AI understand what I wanted to be done. With
            time, as voice recognition and AI technology improves, I do see a larger number of people handing
            over their trivial tasks to AI Assistants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of the three arguments proposed, I agree with the first argument but disagree with the rest. The
            first argument is the Degeneration Argument, stating that you are likely to forget the ability to
            complete a task because you have given your responsibility to the AI. I believe that this is true, the
            more you automate a task, the more likely you are to forget how that task was performed before
            automation. However, I disagree that this would be seen as a problem. The degeneration effect has
            been around since the evolution of mankind. As an example, before the invention of wheels, people
            had to carry their items, offspring, and food over long distances by hand since this was necessary for
            their survival. With the invention of the wheel and carts, people were able to carry items just as well
            if not better than they did without them. This resulted in fewer people carrying items by hand, and
            more people using carts which negatively affected their capability to carry items by hand. Similarly, I
            believe that AI Assistants would without a doubt negatively affect our ability to do trivial tasks,
            however as humanity grows more advanced, the need for us to perform those trivial tasks would
            also reduce, AI Assistants' impact is not something that has never happened before with the
            introduction of new technologies, it is a natural step towards progression.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second argument is the Autonomy Argument, stating that we cannot take responsibility for tasks
            performed by an AI because we did not directly perform those tasks. I disagree with this argument
            because no matter how small in comparison to the task performed, it was performed due to our
            actions. The only reason an AI would do a task for us is that we have either told it to perform that
            task or programmed it to reach the conclusion that the task needs to be completed. We have put an
            effort into that task being accomplished. As an example, let’s consider autonomous robotic vacuum
            cleaners like Roomba. Even though you haven’t personally cleaned out the apartment, you have
            gone through the effort of purchasing the robot, charging it, and powering it on. This process itself
            puts the responsibility of the Roomba’s tasks on you. Using a Roomba is no different from using a
            specialized broomstick, considering it requires less effort and is much more efficient in
            accomplishing its task. AI, much like a Roomba, is a tool that makes it much more efficient to
            complete a task thus putting the responsibility for its actions on us. The last argument is the
            Interpersonal Communication Argument stating that automating interpersonal messages would be
            deception, they would devalue the sentiments behind the message. I disagree with this argument
            because like the autonomy argument if you set up the AI to perform a task, you have put in effort
            towards it performing that given task. If both the receiving and the sending parties are aware of the
            technology being used to automate the interpersonal task, I believe it would not be deception. I also
            feel that phrases like “I love you”, hold sentimental value today because we are all aware of the
            feelings and emotions associated with the word. If an AI started using the phrase and it became a
            common occurrence, people would simply move over to a new/different method to signify their
            feelings. I see this happening using irrational conversations that an AI would have difficulty
            recreating or through key conversation/phrases known only to the parties involved in the
            conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to consider that AI is just another tool we are using to automate our day-to-day lives,
            much like any other tool, it will provide us some benefits however it will also come with some
            disadvantages.
